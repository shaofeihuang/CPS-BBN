# Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Cybersecurity Analysis

This repository contains code and resources for constructing and analysing Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs), that consider probabilities of both cyber and physical attacks.

The code is adapted from the integrated safety and security risk assessment code developed by Bhosale, which can be referenced here: https://github.com/Pbhosale1991/AML-BBN-RA
