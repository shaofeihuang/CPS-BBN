# Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)

This repository contains code and resources for constructing and analysing Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs), that consider probabilities of both cybersecurity vulnerabilities and physical hazards.

The code is adapted from the integrated safety and security risk assessment code developed by Bhosale, which can be referenced here: https://github.com/Pbhosale1991/AML-BBN-RA

Specifically, changes were been made to the original code to improve clarity and correct bugs, as well as to include new functions to identify shortest paths.
